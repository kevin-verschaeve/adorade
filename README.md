# A-DO-RADE !!

Project for fun to measure which people let us going out of our garage to the street.

When someone let us go, we notify it on the project.

Then we have a statistic page to know which kind of people is kinder, or at which period of the year.

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
